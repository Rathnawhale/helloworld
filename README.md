# helloworld
Hello world!

This is my first github profile. I created this profile mainly to improve my coding skills and also to do something useful in bioinformatics. I am planning to work mainly with python and maybe 'R'. The main objective is to learn the languages to the fullest by doing simple projects at first and then gradually moving to complex ones.
